        <h1>HTML</h1>
        <p>An HTML element is a type of HTML (HyperText Markup Language) document component,one
            of several types of HTML nodes (there are also text nodes, comment nodes and others).[vague] 
            HTML document is composed of a tree of simple HTML nodes, such as text nodes, and HTML elements, 
            which add semantics and formatting to parts of document (e.g., make text bold, organize it into 
            paragraphs,lists and tables, or embed hyperlinks and images). Each element can have HTML attributes
            specified.Elements can also have content, including other elements and text.An HTML element is a

            <h2>CSS</h2>
            <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, 
                and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control
                in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting 
                by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the 
                structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the 
                pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>
