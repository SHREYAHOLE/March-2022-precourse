            <p> CSS are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects
                 such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create 
                 structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, 
                 links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. 
                 Other tags surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements.
                 Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.

                of HTML nodes (there are also text nodes, comment nodes and others).[vague]  HTML document is composed of a 
                tree of simple HTML nodes, such as text nodes, and HTML elements, which add semantics and formatting to parts
                of document (e.g., make text bold, organize it into paragraphs,lists and tables, or embed hyperlinks and images).
                Each element can have HTML attributes specified.Elements can also have content, including other elements and text.
